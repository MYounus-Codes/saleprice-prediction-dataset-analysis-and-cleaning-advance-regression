# üè† House Price Prediction Project

This project focuses on predicting **house prices** using **machine learning techniques**.  
It covers the full workflow: **data loading, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, evaluation, and deployment** to build a reliable predictive model for **real estate valuation**.

## üöÄ Installation

To run this project, ensure you have **Python 3.8+** installed.  
It is recommended to use a **virtual environment** to keep dependencies clean.

### **1. Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/saleprice-prediction-dataset-analysis-and-cleaning-advance-regression.git
cd saleprice-prediction-dataset-analysis-and-cleaning-advance-regression
```

### **2. Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you don‚Äôt have a `requirements.txt`, install libraries manually:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn joblib
```

## üìÇ Dataset

The dataset used is the **[House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data)** from **Kaggle**.  

**Description:**
- **Rows:** 1460 entries (training data)
- **Features:** 79 explanatory variables
- **Target Variable:** `SalePrice` (final price of the house)

The dataset contains comprehensive details about residential homes in **Ames, Iowa**, including neighborhood, quality, and size attributes.

## üßπ Data Preprocessing

Before model training, the raw dataset was **cleaned and transformed** to ensure it was ready for machine learning.

### **1. Handling Missing Values**
- **Numerical Columns:**  
  Filled with the **median** value (robust against outliers).
- **Categorical Columns:**  
  Filled with the **most frequent value (mode)** to maintain category distribution.

### **2. Encoding Categorical Variables**
- Applied **One-Hot Encoding** to convert categorical variables into numerical features.
- Ensured no ordinal relationship was falsely introduced.
- The `Id` column was dropped as it is **non-predictive**.

## üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA was conducted to **understand patterns** and **inform preprocessing decisions**.

### **Key Analyses:**
- **SalePrice Distribution:**  
  Checked for skewness and applied transformations if needed.
- **Correlation Matrix:**  
  Identified features most strongly related to `SalePrice`.
- **Categorical Features:**  
  Used **boxplots and violin plots** to visualize relationships with price.
- **Outlier Detection:**  
  Detected extreme values using scatter plots and box plots.

## ü§ñ Model Training

The model selected was **Linear Regression**, a fundamental algorithm for predicting continuous values.

### **Steps:**
1. **Data Splitting:**  
   - `train_test_split()` used to create **80% training** and **20% testing** sets.
2. **Training:**  
   - Fitted the model using **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)** to minimize prediction errors.
3. **Libraries Used:**  
   - `scikit-learn` for model development.

## üìà Evaluation

Model performance was evaluated using standard regression metrics:

| Metric | Description | Ideal Value |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| **MSE (Mean Squared Error)** | Average squared difference between predictions and actual values. | Lower is better |
| **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)** | Square root of MSE, interpretable in original unit (`SalePrice`). | Lower is better |
| **R¬≤ Score (Coefficient of Determination)** | How much variance in `SalePrice` is explained by features. | Closer to 1 is better |

### **Example Results:**
```plaintext
MSE  = 1.45e+09
RMSE = 38,117.25
R¬≤ Score = 0.87
```

## üõ† Usage

Once trained, the model can predict prices for new housing data.

**Important:**  
Ensure **new data is preprocessed in the exact same way** as training data.

```python
import joblib
import pandas as pd

# Load the trained model
model = joblib.load("trained_model.pkl")

# Load new data
new_data = pd.read_csv("new_data.csv")

# Preprocess new_data (must match training preprocessing)
# Example:
# new_data_preprocessed = preprocess_function(new_data)

# Predict
predictions = model.predict(new_data_preprocessed)

# Display results
print(predictions)
```
